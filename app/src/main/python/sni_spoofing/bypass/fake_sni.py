"""Fake SNI bypass strategy.

Sends a fake TLS ClientHello with an allowed SNI that DPI will parse
and whitelist, but the real server will ignore.

Two operating modes:
- With raw sockets (Linux + root): Uses the seq_id trick from the
  original tool. Injects a fake ClientHello with an out-of-window
  TCP sequence number. DPI parses it, server drops it.
- Without raw sockets (fallback): Sends the real ClientHello in
  fragments so DPI cannot read the SNI from any single packet.
  The fake_sni prefix method does NOT work without raw sockets
  because sending the fake on the same TCP stream corrupts the
  TLS handshake.

    low IP TTL) combined with TLS fragmentation.

    Methods:
    - "raw_inject" - Inject fake ClientHello with wrong seq number
      via AF_PACKET. DPI sees it, server drops it. (Linux + root)
    - "ttl_trick" - Send fake with low IP TTL. May reach DPI but
      expire before the server. Works on macOS, Android, Linux.
